        <h1>How It Began</h1>
        <p>Power in Code began as a small club at Masterman High School in Philadelphia, where a passionate group of students gathered to learn coding. As their enthusiasm grew, they shared their knowledge, leading to new chapters at Father Judge, Roman Catholic, Academy at Palumbo, and many more. With each addition, Power in Code transformed from a small club into a citywide organization, with a team of over 15+ trained high school students bringing the love for coding to more than 10 different schools</p>
